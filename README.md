# AJAX To-Do List Lab
We're going to create a To-Do List website. Users will be able
to add items to a list and their items will be stored on the
server. Items will stay in the list when the user refreshes
the page.

## Project Setup

Install all of the project dependencies with `npm install`. The dependencies are
stored inside the `package.json` file that's created when someone runs `npm init`.

Run the server with `nodemon index.js`.
